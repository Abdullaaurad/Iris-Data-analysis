Iris Dataset Analysis in RStudio
Overview
This repository contains an analysis of the Iris dataset, one of the most famous datasets used in machine learning and statistics. The analysis was carried out using RStudio, covering Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), statistical analysis, and visualizations such as pie charts, bar plots, histograms, and scatter plots. Additionally, hypothesis testing is performed on various measurements to draw statistical conclusions.
The Iris dataset contains measurements for different features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) across three species of iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica).
Key Features:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Descriptive statistics
Data visualizations: Pie charts, bar plots, histograms, and scatter plots
Hypothesis testing on Sepal and Petal dimensions
LaTeX-formatted report of findings

Getting Started
To run this analysis on your local machine, follow the steps below.
Prerequisites
You need to have the following installed on your system:

R: Download R
RStudio: Download RStudio
ggplot2: For visualizations
LaTeX (optional, for generating the report)

Installation

Clone the repository:
bashCopygit clone https://github.com/yourusername/iris-dataset-analysis.git

Navigate to the project directory:
bashCopycd iris-dataset-analysis

Install necessary R packages:
RCopyinstall.packages("ggplot2")

Open the iris_analysis.R script in RStudio, and run the code step-by-step for analysis.

Running the Analysis

Open the iris_analysis.R script to explore and run the R code for data analysis.
Check the Visualizations section in the LaTeX report for images generated from the analysis. The report can be compiled if LaTeX is installed, or alternatively, you can view the output images directly.

Important Files:

iris_analysis.R: Contains all R code for data analysis, visualizations, and hypothesis testing.
Report.tex: A LaTeX formatted report detailing the methodology, results, and conclusions.
images/: Folder containing generated images from the analysis (pie chart, bar plot, histograms, etc.).

Output:

Summary Statistics: Insights into the distribution of features like Sepal Length, Petal Length, etc.
Visualizations: Graphical representations of the data, including pie charts, bar plots, histograms, and scatter plots.
Hypothesis Testing Results: Statistical results showing significant differences in sepal/petal dimensions.
Generated Report: The final LaTeX-generated report summarizes the analysis.

Running the Analysis (Detailed)
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The script starts by loading the Iris dataset and performing basic operations like viewing the dataset structure and summary statistics. For example:
RCopyhead(iris)
summary(iris)
2. Visualizations
Several visualizations are created to better understand the dataset:

Pie Chart: Displays the species distribution in the dataset.
Bar Plot: Shows the count of each species.
Histograms: Visualize the distribution of Sepal Length and Petal Length.
Scatter Plot: Shows the relationship between Sepal Length and Petal Length.

3. Hypothesis Testing
The code also runs hypothesis tests (lower-tail, upper-tail, two-tailed) on sepal and petal measurements to test specific assumptions about their values.
RCopyt.test(iris$Sepal.Length ~ iris$Species)
4. LaTeX Report
The analysis results are compiled into a LaTeX report. This document explains the methodology, presents key findings, and includes the generated plots as images.
Future Enhancements

Machine Learning Integration: After performing EDA and statistical testing, this project can be extended to include machine learning models (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM) to predict the species of flowers based on their features.
Additional Hypothesis Testing: More in-depth hypothesis tests could be performed on other aspects of the dataset, such as relationships between petal and sepal measurements for each species.
Advanced Visualizations: Implement more advanced visualizations such as box plots, density plots, or pair plots to better visualize relationships between different features.
Interactive Plots: Incorporating interactive visualizations using packages like plotly or shiny can help make the analysis more dynamic and user-friendly.
Report Generation Automation: Automate the process of generating a LaTeX report from Rmarkdown to make the report more dynamic and reproducible.

Common Errors

Missing Packages: If you encounter errors related to missing libraries, ensure you have installed the necessary R packages:
RCopyinstall.packages("ggplot2")

LaTeX Compilation Error: If LaTeX doesn't compile, ensure that you have a working LaTeX installation. You can install it by following these links:

TeX Live for Linux
MiKTeX for Windows
MacTeX for macOS


File Paths for Images: Ensure that the image paths in the LaTeX file point to the correct directory where the images are stored.
